Multi-lingual game programming.  Many languages, all entity/component systems beautifully composed.

Gives you a truly building-blocks approach to designing animations, simulations, and games.  Bottom up.  Easily create and share your own components, entities, games, partial games, game constructors, procedurally generated games, etc.  They're all just values and easily compose with one another.
